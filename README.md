Todo List App using Ruby on Rails
=====================


Introduction
----------------
This is a Todo List app built using Rails 4.2.4 and Ruby 2.2.3.
I'm using a postgresql database for both development and production environments,
to keep the databases similar on Heroku.

Check out the app on heroku: http://shrouded-oasis-58060.herokuapp.com/


Overview
-------------
This app uses two models: TodoList and TodoItem,
and allows for an item to be created, marked as complete or deleted.
The TodoList follows the general CRUD behaviour where a list has many items

Works for a single user, no login for specific user.
